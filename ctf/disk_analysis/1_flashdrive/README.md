# Disk Analysis 1
This challenge is from VT's Summit CTF 2023.

## Setup
1. Install FTK Imager on Windows. Sorry Linux, there is not an easy way to get FTK Imager for PC. I also could not use Autopsy to complete the challenge.
2. Download the [disk image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AyyPGDMjh_Q6Aa-iUFzqfH2ETC2yAfCv) and extract it. 
3. Open FTK imager and open the unzipped image file into the program.
