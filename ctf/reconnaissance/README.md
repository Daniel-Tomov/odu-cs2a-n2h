# Reconnaissance

## Introduction
To start, let's ask the question `What is reconnaissance?`

Reconnaissance in cybersecurity means gathering information about a specific target. This informaiton can be gathered passively through the Internet where the victim will not be alerted you are looking for information. Another term for passive reconnaissance is `footprinting`. Another way is to go in-person, however, the victim may be alerted you are looking for information.

Reconnaissance CTF challenges ask you to find something on the Internet. When solving these challenges, a search engine is your friend. You will have to search the Internet for the "flag." Hence the name "reconnaissance." Easy challenges could ask you for Abraham Lincoln's birthday, while difficult challenges will give you an image and ask you where it was taken.
