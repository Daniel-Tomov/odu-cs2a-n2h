## Introduction

CTF organizers have started to give challenges similar to [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). The difference is that the player can not move around the map. The challenge puts the player in a certain location on the globe and has the user find it. The user can use any building or object in the view to find their location. The easiest way to complete these challenges is through the use of Google Reverse Image Search.

Today we will be using the `NahamCon2023` challenges on [Geosint](https://osint.golf/). Open the link to start doing the challenges.
